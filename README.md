# RankChoiceVoting
This was a project in my computer science II class.
This was my first project using Java.
Classes Ballot and Result were provided by our professor.
I was tasked with creating ballot objects with the candidates
in the files, and then going through a rank choice voting system
eliminating candidates 1 by 1 and assigning their votes to new 
candidates. The txt files were the ballots given to run.
